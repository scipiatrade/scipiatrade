<h2> Who we are. </h2>

Scipia is a descentralized quant group with research lab structure that is focused on building wealth over time using machine learning algorithms. We use this expertise to deliver superior outcomes for our investors and business partners.

We specialize in alpha capture using multiple approaches like statistical arbitrage, trend following, relative value or factor investing. Our algorithms cover all stages of the investment process: data analysis, signal extraction, signal translation, bet sizing, portfolio construction, strategic asset allocation, risk management, and execution.
